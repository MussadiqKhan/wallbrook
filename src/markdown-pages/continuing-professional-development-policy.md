  ## OBJECT, FORMATION AND TERM OF CONTRACT


  A separate Agreement shall form between the Parties as to each of the following aspects of their relations:


  the Agreement in so far as it does not concern any Service Plan specifically or the User acting as a Workspace Owner;


  the Agreement in relation to each Service Plan specifically, i.e., the Parties' relationship in the context of a particular Service Plan; and


  the Agreement in so far as it concerns the rights and obligations of the User as a Workspace Owner and the Supplier's corresponding rights and obligations (including their respective rights and obligations under the DPA), i.e., the Parties' relationship in the context of the User acting as a Workspace Owner.


  Most Users will thus have more than one Agreement with the Supplier, each governing a different aspect of the Parties' relations and comprising those terms hereof that are relevant to that aspect. Specifically:


  each User shall have an Agreement with the Supplier under subsection 2.1(a), and that Agreement: (α) shall be effective upon the earlier of (i) the party to be identified as the User consenting to the Terms, whether explicitly or impliedly, with implied consent being deemed to have been given by the performance of any of the acts mentioned in the definition of "User", and (ii) the said party becoming identifiable by any of the characteristics used in these Terms to define a User or a Customer (except the attribute "other than the Supplier"); (β) is for an indefinite term, continuing in force until terminated pursuant to its terms or on statutory grounds, except that certain of its provisions (as identified herein) will survive any termination hereof;


  the Subscriber and any User who enjoys any of the benefits of a Service Plan in relation to which he is not the Subscriber shall, as respects the given Service Plan, have an Agreement with the Supplier under subsection 2.1(b). That Agreement: (α) between the Supplier and the Subscriber shall be effective upon the Supplier's acceptance of the order for the Service Plan, whether explicitly or impliedly, with implied acceptance being deemed to have been given by making the relevant Features available; (β) between the Supplier and a User other than the Subscriber shall be effective upon any of the Service Plan's benefits becoming available to the User; and, in either case (γ) shall terminate upon (i) a new Agreement being made between the Supplier and a Subscriber under subsection 2.1(b) in relation to the Workspace concerned, i.e., where the Service Plan attaching to the Workspace is replaced by another, (ii) the expiry of the Service Plan, (iii) the User ceasing to be a member of the Workspace (in which event the Agreement in question will only terminate in respect of the particular User), or (iv) the Workspace being closed;
