FAQ2: Developing recommended strategy
answer2: >-
  Once we have collected the necessary information and analysed your situation,
  needs and objectives, we can prepare your advice and management plan.


  We aim to deliver straight forward solutions to complex problems, balancing cost, required capabilities and your preferred level of engagement in the ongoing investment process.






  Where possible, our investment advice will typically incorporate a preference for institutional-grade investment management, given the value offered in terms of process, resourcing, access and global reach.


  We also allow for constraints and opportunities that are specific to the client situation, such as legacy assets with embedded capital gains, foreign pensions with limited investment options or deferred cash and equity bonuses that pose a concentration risk.


  Any recommendations we make need to consider and align with the advice of your tax and legal advisers, as well as any rules or regulations that your investment structures are subject to.


  Your advice and management plan brings all of these elements together in a strategy focused on meeting your objectives.


  To ensure that you understand the features and risks of the strategies we have recommended, we may also include and discuss education materials on specific asset classes or investment structures.


  Investor education is particularly important where we are introducing a new strategy, to ensure that you are comfortable with your decision to proceed.
FAQ3: Implementing your recommended strategies
answer3: >-
  When you are comfortable with the recommended strategy and ready to proceed,
  we work with the banks and product providers to efficiently implement the
  recommendations and get you on track as quickly as possible.


  We have the flexibility to work with your existing providers, in Australia or abroad, and are experienced in working with a wide range of investment and retirement structures.


  This capability typically means that we can provide you with our service across your entire asset base, reducing your ongoing administrative burden and increasing oversight.

FAQ4: Monitoring and reviewing your progress
answer4: >-
  The key to successfully meeting your goals is ‘staying the course’ while
  monitoring and adapting for external changes in legislation or the economy
  that present material opportunities or risks.


  Client circumstances and objectives also change, and regular monitoring and review helps to ensure that the plan remains relevant.


  Whether you are an individual or part of a family group, it is vital to have a clear view of your position and progress against objectives.


  We can provide you with this oversight and continuity of care.
