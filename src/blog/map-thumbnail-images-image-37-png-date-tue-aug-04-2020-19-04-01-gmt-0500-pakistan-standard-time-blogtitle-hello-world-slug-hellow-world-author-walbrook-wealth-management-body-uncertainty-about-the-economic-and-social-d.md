Uncertainty about the economic and social damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in April. To limit damage, governments began planning to ease restrictions under the shadow of growing social unease and the threat of a second wave of infections. Global markets staged social unease and the threat of governments began planning to ease.

## Rates and Credits:

After reaching record lows in April, unprecedented action from central banks has helped restore order to credit markets, while positive economic news saw an uplift in yields.

The U.S. 10-year yield rose slightly over May from 0.64% to 0.65% before moving higher early in June to just under 0.90% on the back of positive jobs figures and service sector activity. The U.S. Fed remains committed to buying Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in whatever amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. These purchases totalled more than $2 trillion at the end of May and are continuing, although at a reduced pace as the economy shows signs of improvement and liquidity returns to credit markets.

U.S. corporate bond issuance from investment-grade companies — which sit in the top half of the credit-rating table — has crossed $1tn this year, according to data from Refinitiv. That total, which includes debt raised by financial institutions, outpaces the $540bn issued over the same period in 2019, and is closing in on the $1.3tn full-year average over the past five years.
