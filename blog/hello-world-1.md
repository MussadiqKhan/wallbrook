Cultural adaptation or pretesting

The purpose of the cultural adaptation or pretest was to evaluate whether the items of the translated instrument were clearly formulated. Thus, the 47 patients who participated in the pretest were not included in the statistical analysis.

Version 1 of the questionnaire was administered to 20 patients and respective parents. All the respondents understood that the items were about emotional states relating to mood and feelings. However, 20% (n = 4) of the children and adolescents and 15% (n = 3) of the parents did not understand the term “restless” (“inquieto” in Brazilian Portuguese) in item 4 (version 1), so the term was changed to “agitated” (“agitado” in Brazilian Portuguese) in both the child/adolescent and the parent version of the instrument.

The Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire version 2 was then applied to another 27 children and adolescents and their parents, and the cross-cultural equivalence of the scale was retested. The patients and their parents had no doubts about the questionnaire items and found the instrument easy to understand. The mean time taken to answer the questionnaire was five minutes.

#### Questionnaire scores

The mean scores on the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, in the child/adolescent version (n = 77) and the parent version (n = 77) were 6.1 ± 4.4 and 6.9 ± 5.6, respectively. This showed that although the patients were dissatisfied with their physical appearance, they were mentally healthy. No significant difference was observed between scores from the child/adolescent and parent versions of the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (P = 0.407; Wilcoxon test), and only a low correlation was found between the two versions of the instrument (r = 0.268; P = 0.019).

No significant age-related differences in scores from the child/ adolescent version of the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire were found between children up to 11 years of age and those 12 years and older (P = 0.139; Students t test), thus showing that age had no impact on the degree of body dissatisfaction.
